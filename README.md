This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Note: READ FIRST

This template is based on the template by *web3templates* you can find the main repo [here](https://github.com/web3templates/nextly-template/).

I just update it the template to use `typescript` and `app` folder in Next.js 14. 

I wanted a simple starter template that I can use to show case how easy you can add a backend with [Strapi](https://strapi.io).

This is the starter code I will be using in my project, feel free to use it as you please, but the credit goes to the team at *web3templates*.  

Find the original template [here](https://github.com/web3templates/nextly-template/).

Once I finish the Strapi integration, I will add the link to the completed project here.

Original README.md is found below.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
